## About Me

I architect data pipelines and the analytics layer on top of them — the end-to-end work that's increasingly recognized as analytics engineering, sitting at the gap between roles that have traditionally been separate. 10+ years across healthcare and public health, from extraction to insight delivery.

Currently at **Mayo Clinic Arizona** as an Informatics Analyst, owning the full pipeline: Epic Clarity SQL → Microsoft Fabric lakehouse → R Shiny dashboards → stakeholder decisions. MBA in Technology Management · Peer-reviewed publications in computational linguistics & AI governance · Former State University of New York Polytechnic Institute instructor.
